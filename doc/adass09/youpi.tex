% paper with complicated markup. Based on ADASS XI (01) version.
%
% This is a comprehensive example, meaning that we have made use of each
% of the capabilities of the LaTeX + the ASPCONF macro package that we think
% you may need to use. 
%
% Much of the input will be enclosed by braces (i.e., { }).  The
% percent sign, "%", denotes the start of a comment; text after it
% will be ignored by LaTeX.  You might also notice in some of the
% examples below the use of "\ " after a period; this prevents LaTeX
% from interpreting the period as the end of a sentence and putting
% extra space after it.   
% 
% You should check your paper by processing it with LaTeX.  For
% details about how to run LaTeX as well as how to print out the User
% Guide, consult the README file.

\begin{abstract} 
Youpi stands for ``YOUpi is your processing PIpeline''. It is a modern, 
easy to use web application providing high level functionalities to perform 
data reduction on scientific FITS images. Built on top of various open source 
reduction tools released to the community by Terapix, Youpi can help organize 
your data, manage your processing jobs on a computer cluster in real time 
(using Condor) and facilitate teamwork by allowing fine-grain sharing of 
results and data.

\section{Introduction}

Many data reduction pipeline softwares are available today. Youpi is an attempt to
build a rather generic and versatile web-based pipeline suitable for both large 
surveys and smaller PI data processing. It currently supports working with images 
from the Megacam, WIRCam and Ultra-VISTA instruments, and we plan to add support 
for more in the future. 

Youpi is designed to help in data management by keeping track of all data locations 
and parameters involved during the pipeline's life cycle, from the moment FITS images 
are ingested into the database to the moment final processing results are produced.

This pipeline tends to be quite versatile since it can be used on a single host -- a 
desktop computer or even a laptop -- or on larger installations such as computer 
clusters. The project is actively maintained at Terapix, published under an open 
source license and has first been released to the community on September 2009.

\section{Handling FITS Data Ingestion}

Ingesting images is probably the main entry point for firstime users in using Youpi.
Indeed, Youpi provides a way to keep track of your images so you can use them for later 
processing. By selecting -- with a graphical tool (Fig. \ref{fig:pathsel}) -- 
one or several data paths to your FITS images (available either locally or on the 
network by using network shares such as NFS), you will instruct Youpi to read their 
headers and add relevant information to the database, then you will get a detailled 
email report at the end of ingestion. Now that images are ingested once and for all, 
they are available for later processing and tools are provided (see section \ref{sec:ims}) 
to select them by making criteria-based image selections.

\begin{figure}[t]
\epsscale{0.20}
\plotone{ingestion.eps}
\caption{Using the data path selector during image ingestion. Three data paths have 
been selected. Everyone of them will be queued for ingestion on the Condor Cluster.}\label{fig:pathsel}
\end{figure}

\section{Data Processing}

Youpi is a high-level tool acting as a wrapper for freely available, low-level software 
packages released to the astronomer community by Terapix. Through the use of these packages, 
we currently support image quality assessment using the \emph{QualityFITS} software, 
computing astrometric and photometric solutions using \emph{SCAMP}, resampling and co-adding 
images using \emph{SWarp} and extracting sources and building source catalogues using 
\emph{SExtractor}.

All of these processings are internally available as plugins. Some of them can be disabled 
in order to meet your needs. This plugin architecture is very modular and comprehensive 
documentation is available for writting custom plugins that would extend Youpi's default 
processing capabilities.

Since sharing data and results with other people such as PIs or teammates will certainly 
be a necessity at some point, Youpi ensure that only authorized people gain access to data 
you want to expose by simulating a Unix-like file permission system. Most of the data sets 
and results produced can be given permissions for the owner, a group and the rest of the 
world. This way you can define access policy for members of a group and decide whether non 
members can access the data (Fig. \ref{fig:permissions}).

\begin{figure}[t]
\epsscale{0.40}
\plotone{permissions.eps}
\caption{A QualityFITS result set has been given read-write permission for the owner, read-only 
access for all members of group "Terapix" an no access at all for the others.}\label{fig:permissions}

%			      References
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% List your references below within the reference environment
% (i.e. between the \begin{references} and \end{references} tags).
% Each new reference should begin with a \reference command which sets
% up the proper indentation.  
%    NOTE: all citations in the text _must_ have a corresponding entry in 
%    the reference list, and all references must be cited in the text.
%
% Observe the following order when listing bibliographical 
% information for each reference:  author name(s), publication 
% year, journal name, volume, and page number for articles. 
% URLs to the reference may be given either in-line, or as a footnote. 
% Note that many journal names are available as macros; see
% the User Guide for a listing "macro-ized" journals. 
%
% You may find the following tricks to be helpful:
%
%   o  "\ " after a period prevents LaTeX from interpreting the period 
%      as an end of a sentence.
%   o  \adassxvi is a macro that expands to the full title, editor,
%      and publishing information for the ADASS XVI conference
%      proceedings.  Such macros are defined for ADASS conferences I
%      through the most recently published proceedings.
%   o  When referencing a paper in the current volume, use the
%      \adassxvii and \paperref macros.  The argument to \paperref is
%      the paper ID code for the paper you are referencing.  See the 
%      note in the "Paper ID Code" section above for details on how to 
%      determine the paper ID code for the paper you reference.
