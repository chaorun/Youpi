If you want to have an instant use of Youpi, please follow those steps.

How do I put my images inside of Youpi, before processing them?
===============================================================

In order to let Youpi handling your FITS images, the first thing you have 
to do is to indicate Youpi the location of your images in the cluster, this is 
the ingestion.

Go to the ingestion tab and click on the "run ingestion" tab 

1. In the Cluster Path Browser box:

	- Deploy the Network Filesystem by clicking on the "plus" icon
	- Browse directories until reaching your FITS images location(the number between 
	  brackets is a FITS images count)
	- Select single or multiple paths by clicking on the directories of FITS 
	  images (selected paths will be added on the box under the filesystem browser)

	.. Note:: Ability to delete wrong selected path by clicking on the left red cross
			  or the "clear selection" button

2. In the Ingestion parameters and options box:

	*Labelize the future ingestion with identification string or number*
		It permits to find all images ingested under this ingestion ID, for example, for 
		later processing use or sorting issue (See the "How do i process my images?" section)

	*Pay attention to the options*
		You may want to flag your images as good or bad on the fly of the ingestion. 
		Then choose "validated" or "observed".

	There are two others options:
		- Checking the FITS data integrity of images
		- As images are unique by there name, calculating checksum make them unique also by 
		  content.

3. Run ingestions from the selected paths box:

	If you agree with your paths to images in this box you can press the "run ingestions" 
	button.

	.. note:: To have more informations on ingestion under Youpi, see :ref:`ingestion_section`

How do I process my images with Youpi?
======================================

Of course it depends of the kind of processing you want to apply to images, but for 
all processing kind available in Youpi, the following instructions are the same.

Go to the processing tab of the interface and all available processing kinds will be 
listed (understand them as "plugins" of Youpi).

After clicking on your choosen plugin, and assuming that you are aware of how they 
globally work (in term of command line use), you have to browse the red tabs (under the 
processing tab) from the leftest to the rightest by completing each one with your 
parameters (those you'd use in a command line context).
In fact, let's say roughly that each option of your command line corresponds to a plugin tab!

.. image:: /figures/browsing_tabs.png

**Select images**
	First step of the configuration process, it permits to choose images that have been ingested
	according to section above.

	For example, you'd use images from ingestion with a given ingestion ID (See the "How do i put
	my images inside Youpi" section), you just have to select the ingestion ID field in the select
	box and you will see your ingestion ID label.

	Click on the "**Find** images" button to see them appearing. All selected images (see or change
	the check box state of the image) will be those which will be processed.

	.. note:: Many others fields could be used to sort and select images, develop the select box to
	 see them.
  
**Select data paths**
	As the cluster path browser box used during the ingestion, the path selector has the same goal: 
	browse the whole cluster to target your data, and, include them as input data. Once a path 
	is clicked, it is set in the "select path" box. Click on the desired button to assign to the right
	type of data and. Once it's done, select it in the select box of the concerned type.

	.. warning:: understand that you don't target the file itself, you 've just permit to look inside a path
	 			 and Youpi will match for the right name based on differents conventions:

					 - **WEIGHT**: 0123456789.fits will be processed with the 0123456789_weight.fits weight 
					   file, contained in the path you have choosen through this tab.

					 - **AHEAD**: 0123456789.fits needs the 0123456789.ahead file contained in the path you 
					   have choosen.

					 - **FLAT & MASK**: the name of the right flat and mask to use for processing, is 
					   contained in the header of 0123456789.fits. Youpi will match the flat and mask 
					   header's name with files contained in your choosen path.

**Select a configuration file**
	If configuration files for such softwares as SCamp, Sextractor, etc ... have no secrets for you, you can:
		- Use the default one, provided by the soft (choose default file in the select box).
		- Edit the default to design your own configuration file and save it in the database for later use.
		- Import several configuration files to match by selection names from image selector (see 
		  :ref:`image_selector_section`).

**Set output directory**
	Every plugins(kind of processing) running under Youpi, create output data. You can 
	decide to store output data in the output directory of your choice (see :ref:`output_directory_section`).

	.. warning:: For now, Youpi allows only creation of one level depth directory.
 
**Add to cart and run processing tasks**
	Complete the configuration of processing by pressing the "add to cart" button. Go to 
	the "processing cart" tab, in the top right of the interface, to see your own processing 
	tasks added. Press the "run" button to launch your processing tasks on the cluster.

How do I check status of my processings tasks (jobs) on the cluster?
====================================================================

Go to the left tabs menu and press the "Active Monitoring" tab. Youpi displays all jobs 
running on the cluster. A status is provided for each job and killing jobs is enabled 
if they are yours.

How do I check results from processing ?
========================================

Go to the left tabs menu and press the "Results" tab. Select the owner and the kind of
processings you want to display, by completing criterias in the "processing history"
panel, on the left. You can even search for the processed image name in the funnel text box.
Click on the "start searching" button.

After filtering your results by criterias, processings tasks are displayed as vertical 
scrollbar list. Click on the box, relative to your expected image processing result, and 
the result of the processed image will appear.
