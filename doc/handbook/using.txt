Using Youpi
***********
The Youpi web interface is splitted in tabs. Each tab corresponds to a specific
task and, this section, will describe the functionnality related to the tab header.

Before diving into Youpi, let's first introduce to the basic functionnalities of
the pipeline.


Guided Tour of Functionalities
==============================

FITS Data Ingestion
-------------------

.. image:: /figures/ingestion.png
   :width: 800
   :scale: 90

A FITS image is the most important entity in youpi.
The ingestion process make your images their first entries in the pipeline.
 


Once your cluster path is defined in your configuration files, you can easily 
browse your cluster to find out which directories contain FITS images from the 
cluster path browser.
 

It is a real time tree view of your cluster architecture.
Powerful and user friendly, here is a graphical way to navigate through folders and 
have a quick view of the number of contained FITS images. It counts automatically 
the number of FITS images, and, display it after the name of the folder. No number 
means no fits image.

Several paths can be selected by clicking on folders from the browser and your 
selections will appear in the box below. 
From the selected paths box you can clear all selections you've done by clicking the
"clear selection" button, or, if you only want to delete one of your selected paths,
click on the red cross button ahead of the path.

Before clicking on the "run ingestion" button, let's see some others features of the 
ingestion tab process:

- You can give an identification text field for your ingestion in order to distinguish it 
  from others, or to find easily your set of ingested images.
- A log file is generated each time an ingestion has run and finished. 
  This log file can be sent as email at the end of the ingestion, by quoting the check 
  box before running ingestions.
- You can also see previous ingestions in the history tab of the ingestion page, and
  their relative options.


A set of options is proposed to add a fine-grain control during ingestion:

- **Observed vs validated data**

 For each ingestion done under Youpi, you can specify a flag "validated" or "observed"
 which will be applied for all ingested images, and let you determine a first step of
 classification and validation.
 Flag images as validated means that future ingested images are usable for science issue.
 Flag images as observed is the opposite, and permit to exclude automatically from 
 future processing.

- **Data integrity control**
 
 Fitsverify is integrated to the ingestion at its low level checking, it will 
 verify that the structure of the FITS image is not corrupted and will not affect 
 the futur processing of it.

- **Youpi allows the possibility to ingest the same image many times**

 The image will have the same name but the generated checksum, computed and linked 
 to the image in the youpi database, will be different.
 Youpi allows to keep data integrity, uniqueness, and tracks of the ingestion process.



.. note:: Server side, for each image a database entry is created and filled with relevant 
		  informations contained in the FITS header (run, instrument, Ra, Dec, observation
		  date, channel...) and others computed on the fly of the ingestion (center of the
		  field, sky footprint, checksum).


It adds more flexibility for searching, classifying, sorting operations which are needed 
during the image lifetime and through the pipeline.


Deal With Condor Setup
----------------------

.. image:: /figures/condor.png
   :width: 800
   :scale: 90

The condor Setup tab will show in real time your cluster status and let customize basic or
advanced policies related to your cluster functionalities. Condor is a specialized workload
management system for compute-intensive jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor 
provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring
and resource management. Linked to Youpi, it automatically probes your cluster, list all
computation nodes(processors) in the pool, and display availability and status for all of them.
Youpi also provides high level condor controls on its condor set up interface.

There are 2 different ways to dispatch resources from this interface:

- Automatic custom by setting policies:

 Policies are automatic selections based on the characteristics of each machine of your 
 cluster. It may be interesting to select automatically all machines with available 
 memory greater than 8 GB of RAM (for a scamp processing), or to exclude from the pool,
 machines with a specified name. So you can divide your cluster and save those sub nodes
 selection as policies in order to use predefined sub pool for a specific processing.

- Manual custom by setting custom selections:

 If the characteristics of your cluster have no secrets for you, and you decide to make
 selections of nodes manually, you have to use the "Available Cluster Nodes" box and 
 save them as custom selections.


 .. note:: Adding a default policy to a kind of processing will be treated in the Set up
	Your Preferences part. Adding a special policy to a kind of processing will be treated 
	in the Processing Your Data part.


Set up Your Preferences
-----------------------

.. image:: /figures/preferences.png
   :width: 800
   :scale: 90

The preference tab in the Youpi interface is as important as the condor setup tab.
It handles global options for youpi and it is user dependant. Each user can set his
preferences for processing data, manage his style themes and define his own permissions.

- Default shopping cart item behaviour

 You can define a **default shopping cart item behaviour**, means if you intend to use 
 policies or selections, for each processing plugin of youpi. Once this done, you can
 opt for the selections and policies you have created in the **Condor setup**, and 
 affect to plugins.

- Default permissions

 Youpi authorize to fully custom your data permissions as a user/group UNIX like 
 permissions.You can change the default one (set to 640) or change the visibility
 for a group or anyone.
 
- Themes

 To improve readability, Youpi provides themes that can be changed anytime, during
 your navigation.It makes Youpi interface more accessible, for example concerning 
 visually impaired users.


Organize your data with tags
----------------------------

.. image:: /figures/tag.png
   :width: 800
   :scale: 90

Tags are keywords or terms associated with or assigned to a piece of information.
In the Youpi case, let's say that this is a metadata (a text field) that you could
assigned to one or a set of images to "labelize" them. Then it will help you find
your "foo" set or your "bar" group of images.

The tagging tab interface is divided in two parts:

- Available tags
 
 it shows all tags created in Youpi. You can add a new tag by completing the drop
 down box with:

	- a mandatory name (the one which is displayed)
	- a comment (not mandatory)
	- a style color for text, background and border

Tags can be edited, and shared by changing visibility permissions, like your data.
Then restrictions to a group or to the rest of the world, the graphic elements of 
tags can be set up through this part by double clicking on the tag. 


- Select images

As explained in the image selector section, once your selection is done, youpi has
a drag and drop solution that is simply to grab the tag you want to apply to images,
drag it on the empty light blue box of the image selector and mark (or unmark ) your
selection.

 .. Note:: A tag is a selection parameter that you can use in the image selector in 
	order to find all images with a specific tag, for example untag a tagged selection. 

Processing Your Data
--------------------

.. image:: /figures/processing.png
   :width: 800
   :scale: 90

For each plugin implemented, as a computing process which could be run on FITS images 
through Youpi, there are severals steps to observe, represented as tabs as shown in the
figure. To process images and for each plugin, you must pass through each tab of the 
plugin from the left to the right.

The first is the selection of a subset of ingested images in Youpi. So, a powerfull 
selection tool has been made, which allows to sort, group images by specific fields: 
the **image selector**.

The image selector
------------------

An instance of the image selector is provided for each plugin under the "select images"
tab. If you want to select all images in Youpi, observed through "i.MP9701" channel, and 
among them, select all images contained in the D1 field of the sky, this tool will 
automatically do the selection for you.

There are two kind of selections:

 - Single selection
 
 In single selection you will be able to constuct basics selections of images, based on:
 
 	- several FITS header fields and others types of criteria
	- on a list of images in plain-text separated by semicolons

 You can even import *n* plain-text files in order to construct *n* basic selections.



 - Batch selection

Batch selection grant to raise multiple selections based on coordinates on the 
celestial sphere. You can define circles with a center and a radius and each image
which have his center field **in** the circle, will be selected. XML files with
a special DTD are the means to do such selections in Youpi.

Here is the DTD

::

 <batch>
 	<selection>
 		<label>SEL1</label>
 		<alpha>33.1</alpha>
 		<delta>-6.3</delta>
 		<radius>0.1</radius>
 	</selection>
 	<selection>
 		<label>SEL2</label>
 		<alpha>22.0</alpha>
 		<delta>-6.3</delta>
 		<radius>0.1</radius>
 	</selection>
 	...
 </batch>


Alpha, delta are the circle coordinates center. Each selection node is a proper one.	
With this other method of selection, you will have one list of as many selection nodes
as contained in the XML file.A sky visualisation of your selections in batch mode, is 
generated (even the center of each image selected).To see this visualisation, check 
the corresponding checkbox on the image selector in Batch selection.

 
.. Note:: For all selections you have done under single or batch mode, it's possible to save, edit or 
 delete selections from the top left panel of the image selector.

Processing your data considering plugins
----------------------------------------

Most of plugins require specific input data, as weight maps, flat maps ahead files etc.
The select data path tab helps you inputting such files when they don't appear to be an
output product of an other plugin, or simply at the beginning of the pipeline process.

Custom configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every plugins need a configuration file to run, and, they all have a default configuration
file for generic processing. Youpi provides the default one for each implemented plugin.
If you need to finely tune your processing, you can also create your own by editing in place
the default one in the configFile editor, or upload it from your computer. Once your tuned
file has been saved, select it and you can go to the next tab.

.. Warning:: A plugin configuration file obeys to a formal syntax, changing keyword value
 would be sufficient ...

Set output directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every plugin outputs are written by default in a preseted path:

::

/processing_output/user/plugin/

The processing output directory is defined at the first step of Youpi configuration. Then
youpi completes this path with the Youpi's user name and the name of the plugin concerned 
by the processing.You can add one more custom level directory in the output directory tab.

::

/processing_output/user/plugin/mySpecialProcess/

Input versus Output validation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each plugin implemented in Youpi has its own input/output data. In a pipeline context,
output data from one could be the input of another, and every IN/OUT dependancies between
them, are handled. The input data validation tab has its purpose, take care of ouput-input
bridges between plugins. when all previous tabs have been treated, the only thing you have
to do is click in the input data validation button to see if things are going well.If it's 
not, you might assume that previous tabs have not been fully carried or just missed.

Adding to the cart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you pass through all tabs of your plugin, it means that you are now about to add your 
processing to the cart. By clicking on the ADD TO CART button (in the top right of the 
interface) a message will appears to confirm that. If something is wrong an error message
will guide you to the related tab which needed to be fixed.

The Shopping Cart
-----------------

.. image:: /figures/shopping.png
   :width: 800
   :scale: 90

The shopping cart comes naturally, after adding to cart one or many processings, elaborated
from plugins of the *processing your data* tab. It represents a visual synthesis of 
processings, sorted by plugin and ready to be run. A summary of your parameters are shown 
as a quick view. Then you can decide to delete, save for a later use, or run the 
corresponding processing as *jobs*, handled by Condor. The *saved items* tab will summarize
your saved processings with elementary informations, and an *add to cart* click will push 
them back to the cart, ready to be computed.

.. Note:: During your logged session, if cookies are activated, you will keep your cart
 with your items added, even if you continue browsing the Youpi interface and without 
 saving them. But it is recommended to *save for later* your items in the cart, not to be 
 punish by a simple network disconnection.

Runtime options are about management of jobs through Condor. If you have set a default 
condor configuration (i.e Condor Setup), or if you intend to provide a custom configuration 
for a specific process, it can be managed through this dropdown box.

Live Monitoring of Processings
------------------------------

.. image:: /figures/activemonitoring.png
   :width: 800
   :scale: 90

After having launched jobs, from the shopping cart to the Condor management system, Youpi 
provides a realtime instant view of all proccessed jobs, with related nodes in which jobs
are running, the management status, the owner. You will be able to  kill your own jobs and 
assuming that you give data permissions to your team, they could do the same.The interface 
for live monitoring is decomposed in pages referencing 10 running jobs per pages (pages are
represented by the top red numbers above jobs).


Processing Results
------------------

.. image:: /figures/results.png
   :width: 800
   :scale: 90

The processing history tab is separated for the moment, in 2 parts. The first one is a 
*processing selector* under the *history* tab, and proposes a custom search of processings 
by plugin: filtering by user, status, plugin and displaying jobs results in the right panel 
on click on the desired result. Results in red are the one which failed, green are successful.

Once you click on the results you want to display, you can see a full description of it in the
right panel. For every plugins some of element results are the same:
 
 - Images, as produced png files from the processing, can be viewed by clicking on their displayed thumb version
 - permissions that have been defined for this processing
 - A set of Condor LOG files(output log, main log, error log) are available in one click
 - the running parameters and the related configuration file you set to launch the job are viewable(dropdown box)
 - the plugin output information

The second part is the *statistics* tab and permit, by browsing your related output directory
processing, to resume processing images status. It is a quick way to know if 100% of your images
group has been successfully processed.



Generating Reports
------------------
.. image:: /figures/reporting.png
   :width: 800
   :scale: 90

Every actions, leaded by the user during his session on youpi, have database impacts. It
means that, at anytime, youpi could generate from your account, global or very specific reports.
The reports engine works with a graphic library, and can generate statistic images including
histogramms, plots and many others features that could enhance graphically your data results
from the pipeline.

Cookbook
========

If you want to have an instant use of Youpi, please follow those steps.
Understand that you can use it as a image processing pipeline, or an image 
processing software.

How do I put my images inside of Youpi, before processing them?
---------------------------------------------------------------

In order to let Youpi handling your FITS images, the first thing you have 
to do is to indicate Youpi the location of your images in the cluster, this is 
the ingestion.

Go to the ingestion tab and click on the "run ingestion" tab 

**1. In the Cluster Path Browser box:**

- Deploy the Network Filesystem by clicking on the "plus" icon
- Browse directories until reaching your FITS images location(the number between 
  brackets is a FITS images count)
- Select single or multiple paths by clicking on the directories of FITS 
  images (selected paths will be added on the box under the filesystem browser)

.. Note:: Ability to delete wrong selected path by clicking on the left red cross
 or the "clear selection" button

**2. In the Ingestion parameters and options box:**

- Labelize the future ingestion with identification string or number 

It permits to find all images ingested under this ingestion ID, for example, for 
later processing use or sorting issue (See the "How do i process my images?" section)

- Pay attention to the options 

You may want to flag your images as good or bad on the fly of the ingestion. 
Then choose "validated" or "observed".

There are two others options:

- Checking the FITS data integrity of images
- As images are unique by there name, calculating checksum make them unique also by 
  content.

**3. Run ingestions from the selected paths box:**

If you agree with your paths to images in this box you can press the "run ingestions" 
button.

How do I process my images with Youpi?
--------------------------------------

Of course it depends of the kind of processing you want to apply to images, but for 
all processing kind available in Youpi, the following instructions are the same.

Go to the processing tab of the interface and all available processing kinds will be 
listed (understand them as "plugins" of Youpi).

After clicking on your choosen plugin, and assuming that you are aware of how they 
globally work (in term of command line use), you have to browse the red tabs (under the 
processing tab) from the leftest to the rightest by completing each one with your 
parameters.
In fact, let's say roughly that each option of your command line corresponds to a plugin tab!

.. image:: /figures/browsing_tabs.png

- **Select images**

First step of the configuration process, it permits to choose images that have been ingested
according to section above.

For example, you'd use images from ingestion with a given ingestion ID (See the "How do i put
my images inside Youpi" section), you just have to select the ingestion ID field in the select
box and you will see your ingestion ID label.

Click on the "**Find** images" button to see them appearing.

- **Select data paths**
- **Select a configuration file**
- **Set output directory**
