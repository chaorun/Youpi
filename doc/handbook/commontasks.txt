Changing Permissions
====================

.. versionadded:: 0.6

Global permissions can be set for restricting user accounts. They apply for both groups and
users. Changing user or group permissions requires to log in to the administration interface, 
available from the login page by following the "Access the administration interface" link. Only 
user accounts with the ``Staff status`` permission are allowed to log into the admin site.

Once logged on the admin site, select a group or user from the ``Auth`` section on the page then 
scroll down to the ``Permissions`` subsection. All permissions are available as a multi-selection 
list. Some of them are internally defined by Django and *are not used* by Youpi (selecting them would 
have no effect).

Here is the list of supported permissions in Youpi. Select any of the following to grant 
permission:

**Add tags**
	Select the ``youpi | Tags | Can add Tags`` entry in order to allow users adding their own 
	image tags. Note that this permission is for creating tags only. Owners of already existing tags 
	but without this permission will be able to update or delete them.

**Submit jobs on the cluster**
	Select the ``youpi | site profile | Can submit jobs on the cluster`` entry to allow users submitting
	jobs on the cluster. This permission is required in order to submit jobs from the processing cart and 
	in order to run ingestions (because ingestions are submitted as cluster jobs too).

**View ingestion logs**
	Select the ``youpi | site profile | Can view ingestion logs`` entry to allow users viewing ingestion 
	logs from the ingestion page. They are produced at the end of every ingestion and may contain information 
	that you want to keep private.

**Monitor running jobs on the cluster**
	Select the ``youpi | site profile | Can monitor running jobs on the cluster`` entry to allow users 
	monitoring jobs submitted by Youpi to the cluster.

**View processing results**
	Select the ``youpi | site profile | Can view processing results`` entry to allow users to display 
	processing results from the ``Results`` page.

**Generate reports**
	Select the ``youpi | site profile | Can generate reports`` entry to allow users generating reports 
	from the ``Reporting`` page.

**Run a software version check**
	Select the ``youpi | site profile | Can run a software version check`` entry to allow users running
	software version checks from the ``Active Monitoring`` page. Note that version checks expose all 
	software versions of low-level tools used by Youpi on the cluster.

**Use the QualityFits plugin**
	Select the ``youpi | site profile | Can use QualityFits plugin`` entry to allow users using the 
	QualityFITS plugin. If granted, the plugin icon will appear on the ``Processing`` page.

**Use the Scamp plugin**
	Select the ``youpi | site profile | Can use Scamp plugin`` entry to allow users using the 
	Scamp plugin. If granted, the plugin icon will appear on the ``Processing`` page.

**Use the Sextractor plugin**
	Select the ``youpi | site profile | Can use Sextractor plugin`` entry to allow users using the 
	Sextractor plugin. If granted, the plugin icon will appear on the ``Processing`` page.

**Use the Swarp plugin**
	Select the ``youpi | site profile | Can use Swarp plugin`` entry to allow users using the 
	Swarp plugin. If granted, the plugin icon will appear on the ``Processing`` page.

**Use the Skeleton processing plugin**
	Select the ``youpi | site profile | Can use Skeleton DEMO processing plugin`` entry to allow users 
	using the Skeleton plugin. If granted, the plugin icon will appear on the ``Processing`` page.
