Preface
*******

To get the best possible performance and efficiency out of multi-core CPUs, we use data 
reduction tools which are often low-level, multi-threaded computer programs generally 
used from the command line. |terapix|_ and |astromatic|_ provide such (open source)
low-level tools for years now, and the Youpi processing pipeline is an attempt to 
get an easy-to-use, high-level web application to handle common daily tasks such as 
ingesting FITS images into a database, organizing and preparing data for processing, 
running jobs on a cluster of machines, getting the results and generating reports.

Youpi acts as a glue between those low-level tools. Its development line mainly focuses 
on providing a modern graphical user interface (GUI) and the ability to easily organize and 
share data between users.

Youpi Features
==============

Youpi comes with helper tools to:

*Ingest FITS images*
    By providing a data path in which Youpi will find all `FITS` images, images header 
    information is read and stored in the database. As we will see later, this 
    information is used in almost every part of the application, from image selection 
    to job submission on a cluster. Image ingestion is discussed later and has 
    a :ref:`dedicated section <ingestion_section>`.

*Organize image collections with tags*
    In order to be able to process a selection of images on a cluster, well, images have 
    to be selected first. Youpi provides an integrated :ref:`image selector <image_selector_section>` 
    widget to select images based on various criteria, mostly mapping the `FITS` image's header 
    keywords. But what if you need a more advanced, flexible way to select bunch of (possibly 
    unrelated) images? Youpi supports :ref:`applying tags <organize_tags_section>` --- that 
    is, simple, easy to remember names --- to image selections, making those annotated 
    selections easy to retrieve, at any time.

*Set up processing tasks*
    Youpi supports several type of processings that can be used with image selections. 
    The standard distribution provides plugins for :ref:`evaluating the quality <proc_fitsin>` 
    of an image, computing :ref:`astrometric and photometric solutions <proc_scamp>` for 
    a set of images, :ref:`resampling and co-adding <proc_swarp>` together images and building 
    :ref:`catalogues of objects <proc_sextractor>` from an astronomical image. There is 
    also a plugin for batch :ref:`converting FITS images to the TIFF format <proc_stiff>`.

    Each of those *processing tasks* can be accomplished within Youpi in a similar way, 
    by first making an image selection, selecting paths to external files such as 
    weight maps, flats or masks, then selecting a proper configuration file to use with 
    that processing and finally defining a directory where output data (products) 
    will be stored after processing.

*Define rules to match only subsets of a cluster*
    Maybe you don't plan or want to use all the cluster nodes available at a time. In 
    order to use a limited set of cluster nodes for a processing, Youpi provides flexible 
    solutions to :ref:`define selections of nodes<condor_setup>` you want to use. Those 
    selections can be saved and associated to a specific category of processings.

*Perform batch processing*
    blah blah

*Monitor and kill jobs running on the cluster*
    in realtime from the interface

*Access output results*
    blah blah

*Get statistics and generate reports*
    blah blah
