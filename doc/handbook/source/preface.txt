Preface
*******

To get the best possible performance and efficiency out of multi-core CPUs, we use data 
reduction tools which are often low-level, multi-threaded computer programs generally 
used from the command line. |terapix|_ and |astromatic|_ provide such (open source)
low-level tools for years now, and the Youpi processing pipeline is an attempt to 
get an easy-to-use, high-level web application to handle common daily tasks such as 
ingesting FITS images into a database, organizing and preparing data for processing, 
running jobs on a cluster of machines, getting the results and generating reports.

Youpi acts as a glue between those low-level tools. Its development line mainly focuses 
on providing a modern graphical user interface (GUI) and the ability to easily organize and 
share data between users.
