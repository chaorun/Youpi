Youpi stands for "YOUpi is your processing PIpeline". It is a modern, easy 
to use web application providing high level functionalities to perform data 
reduction on scientific `FITS`_ images. 

Built on top of various open source reduction tools released to the community 
by |terapix|_, Youpi can help organize your data, manage your processing jobs 
on a computer cluster in real time (using `Condor`_) and facilitate teamwork 
by allowing fine-grain sharing of results and data. 

Built from the ground up with modularity in mind, Youpi comes with plugins allowing 
to perform, from within a browser, various processing tasks such as evaluating the 
quality of incoming images (using the ``QualityFITS`` software package), computing 
astrometric and photometric solutions (using ``SCAMP``), resampling and co-adding 
FITS images (using ``SWarp``) and extracting sources and building source catalogues 
from astronomical images (using ``SExtractor``).  

Whether you are dealing with small to medium-sized data reduction projects, 
Youpi can be a powerful alternative to other pipeline data reduction software. 
Youpi is free software and published under the `GNU General Public License`_.

This handbook covers the installation and day to day use of Youpi. Please note 
that this manual is a work in progress. As such, some sections may be incomplete.
