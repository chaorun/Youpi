Image Processing
****************

Youpi provides several plugins, each of them dedicated to a specific task. In the following 
sections, we will see how to use the user interface (UI) to quickly create jobs ready to be 
sent to a cluster.

Common widgets and tools
========================

Every image processing capabilities offered by Youpi's plugins are possible using a common set 
of UI widgets dealing with image selection, configuration file selection and data path selection.

.. _image_selector_section:

The Image Selector
------------------

Let's first begin with the image selector (*IMS*). All images previously ingested in the database 
are searchable using the IMS. Several search criteria can be combined. The result is a 
selection of images that can later be edited (saved, reloaded, deleted, merged). As shown in the 
following image, the IMS is made of four parts:

.. image:: figures/ims-main.png

The top-left part is the current *selection mode*, which is one of *single* or *batch*. The 
single mode is the default one and, as its name implies, allows to create a single selection 
of images. On the contrary, the batch mode automatically import and save selections defined 
in an XML file.

The three other parts (highlighted in orange) are only available in the *single* selection 
mode.

Single selection mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basic usage
"""""""""""

Select a search criteria from the top right search area. Available criteria are among: 
channel, ra/dec, image grade, image name, ingestion ID, instrument, object, run name, 
saved selection and tag:

.. image:: figures/ims-criteria.png
   :class: capture

Once a criterium is selected, matched values are loaded automatically in the rightmost
select box. For example, selecting the *Run* criterium will load a list of all available 
runs:

.. image:: figures/ims-run-criterium.png
   :class: capture

Note that depending on the selected criterium, the rightmost widget can be a multi-selection 
box (for the *channel*, *grade*, *ingestion ID*, *object*, *run* and *tag* criterium) or a single 
selection box (for the *instrument* and *saved selection* criterium) or a single line edit for 
entering values manually (suitable for the *ra/dec* coordinates and the *image name* criterium). 
All images whose names contain the string "7323" can be searched with:

.. image:: figures/ims-crit-edit.png
   :class: capture

.. note:: Regular expressions are not supported in line edit fields at the moment.

Only one instrument per line is available:

.. image:: figures/ims-crit-single.png
   :class: capture

Finally, just hold the control key to select multiple values in a multi-selection box. Every 
entry selected is used as a **logical OR** operation:

.. image:: figures/ims-crit-multi.png
   :class: capture

We just saw selecting only one kind of criterium for retreiving images. But what if you 
want to combine them? Well, just press the ``+`` button to get a new line with a new 
criterium. You can use as many lines as you want. The criteria and their values (and 
conditions) will be merged into a query and sent to Youpi when you hit the "*Find Images!*" 
button. Every line is used as a **logical AND** operation. In the following example, we 
are looking for all ``Megacam`` images in the ``g.MP9401`` filter with the ``Wide`` tag:

.. image:: figures/ims-multi-line.png
   :class: capture

Of a collection of 50713 images, there are 2549 matches. Since it's a rather large results 
set, it's splitted on several pages. Each page (except the last one generally) has the same 
number of matches, one image per line.

Filtering results
"""""""""""""""""

You can jump to any page by using the page selector widget in the results header. You can 
select the page number directly or select the page in the list. This will fetch the results 
automatically.

.. image:: figures/ims-page-selector.png
   :class: capture

Each result line shows information about one single image. Only the name of the image is 
displayed, along with all its tags. By default, all images in the result set are checked/selected. 
You can unselect some of them at will. Shortcuts are available to un/select all images on a 
page or even to un/select all images on all pages at once. 

Use the *Select page* or "*Unselect page*" buttons in the page selector to respectively select or 
unselect all images in the current page. In the following example, only the third image on page 5 
is selected by first hitting the *Unselect page* then check the checkbox at the beginning of the 
third line:

.. image:: figures/ims-single-entry.png
   :class: capture

You can also un/select all entries on all pages at once by hitting the appropriate button in 
the left panel. Suppose you want to unselect all images and select only the first 2 images on 
the first page:

.. image:: figures/ims-unselect-all.png
   :class: capture

Editing a selection
"""""""""""""""""""

Now that you are pretty satisfied with the current selection of images, you can save it for a 
later use by hitting the "*Save selection*" button in the left panel. You will be asked for a name, 
which must be unique across all saved selections:

.. image:: figures/ims-save-sel.png
   :class: capture

You can later load this selection back by using the *Saved selection* criterium:

.. image:: figures/ims-reload-sel.png
   :class: capture

The access permissions of a selection can also be changed, so you can decide who can view or 
modify a saved selection. Just hit the "*Edit selection*" button in the left panel, select the 
name of a saved selection then click on the *Change* link. You will be prompt for new permissions:

.. image:: figures/ims-edit-perms.png
   :class: capture

Saved selections can also be deleted the same way. Hit the "*Delete selection*" button and select 
a selection to delete:

.. image:: figures/ims-del-sel.png
   :class: capture

Finally, selections can be merged. Load back the ``CFHT-sel`` saved image selection, hit the "*Find 
images!*" button then hit the "*Merge with selection*" button in the left panel. Select one or more 
selections in the list to *merge into* the current ``CFHT-sel`` selection:

.. image:: figures/ims-merge-sel.png
   :class: capture

.. note:: All images from the selected selections will be added to the current list of images, but 
          the new expanded list will not be saved automatically. The saved selection ``CFHT-sel`` 
          remains untouched until you manually save the new selection (can have the same name).

Images selection from a file
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Instead of selecting images according to some criteria, you may find more convenient to upload a plain 
text file in order to make a selection of images. You can do that by hitting the "*Select from text*" 
button:

.. image:: figures/ims-upload-file.png
   :class: capture

An upload form will popup for browsing a local text file. The plain text file has the following format:
one image name per line (without the ``.fits`` extension), and optionnally its md5 checksum (using a 
coma "``,``" separator)::

    1013501p,3d4412ec29b24210f7c3634cca43caa4
    1013502p,9e447830680d4b727023ef19102c0f50
    1013502p,dd39a2b7c1b4646c59b335afe84288ff
    1013503p

Let's upload this file using default options and hit the "*upload*" button:

.. image:: figures/ims-upload-over.png
   :class: capture

The image selector reports all the files described in the uploaded file have been found in the database. 
Since the option for tagging images on the fly was checked, the 4 images have been tagged with the 
``imglist`` tag, which is the base name of the file, with no extension. Note that you can exit the form 
upload display by clicking on the "*go back*" link, and that, while the current selection will be cleaned 
if you do so, you will be able to retreive it by selecting the *Tag* criterium with the value 
``imglist``:

.. image:: figures/ims-upload-reload.png
   :class: capture

Batch importing files
"""""""""""""""""""""

Here is another way to import bunch of files and make (and save) selections automatically with the 
IMS. Hit the "*Batch import*" button then click on the line open the path selector. A dialog will 
pop up. Select a data path on the filesystem where all your selection files are located then click 
*OK*. In the following example, we created two selection files named ``sel1.txt`` and ``sel2.txt`` 
available in the ``matm`` network directory:

.. image:: figures/ims-batch-import1.png
   :class: capture

``sel1.txt`` and ``sel2.txt`` have the following content::

    1013501p,3d4412ec29b24210f7c3634cca43caa4
    1013502p,9e447830680d4b727023ef19102c0f50

and::

    1013502p,dd39a2b7c1b4646c59b335afe84288ff
    1013503p

Once selected, just hit the "*Import!*" button to import those two files. They will be imported as 
new selections and available for searching.

Batch selection mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Batch selection grant to raise multiple selections based on coordinates on the 
celestial sphere. You can define circles with a center and a radius and each image
which have his center field **in** the circle, will be selected. XML files with
a special DTD are the means to do such selections in Youpi.

Here is an example::

    <batch>
        <selection>
            <label>SEL1</label>
            <alpha>33.1</alpha>
            <delta>-6.3</delta>
            <radius>0.1</radius>
        </selection>
        <selection>
            <label>SEL2</label>
            <alpha>22.0</alpha>
            <delta>-6.3</delta>
            <radius>0.1</radius>
        </selection>
        ...
    </batch>

Alpha, delta are the circle coordinates center. Each selection node is a proper one.	
With this other method of selection, you will have one list of as many selection nodes
as contained in the XML file.A sky visualisation of your selections in batch mode, is 
generated (even the center of each image selected).To see this visualisation, check 
the corresponding checkbox on the IMS in Batch selection.
 
.. Note:: For all selections you have done under single or batch mode, it's possible to save, 
          edit or delete selections from the top left panel of the IMS.

.. Note:: ** saved selections matching mode **
