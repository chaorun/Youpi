Abstract
--------

Youpi stands for "YOUpi is your processing PIpeline". It is a modern, easy 
to use web application providing high level functionalities to perform data 
reduction on scientific `FITS`_ images. Built on top of various open source 
reduction tools released to the community by |terapix|_, Youpi can help 
organize your data, manage your processing jobs on a computer cluster in real 
time (using `Condor`_) and facilitate teamwork by allowing fine-grain sharing 
of results and data. Built from the ground up with modularity in mind, Youpi 
comes with plugins allowing to perform, from within a browser, various processing 
tasks such as evaluating the quality of incoming images (using the ``QualityFITS`` 
software package), computing astrometric and photometric solutions (using ``SCAMP``), 
resampling and co-adding FITS images (using ``SWarp``) and extracting sources and 
building source catalogues from astronomical images (using ``SExtractor``).  
Whether you are dealing with small to medium-sized data reduction projects, 
Youpi can be a powerful alternative to other pipeline data reduction software. 
Youpi is free software and published under the `GNU General Public License`_.

This handbook covers the installation and day to day use of Youpi. Please note 
that this manual is a work in progress. As such, some sections may be incomplete.
