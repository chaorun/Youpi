Installing Youpi
****************

This chapter is about installing Youpi in a *GNU/Linux* environment. Actually, it should 
work on most UNIX-like systems that support |python|_ (quite a lot). For example, Youpi 
is currently hosted on a `FreeBSD`_ server at |terapix|_. 

For the moment, two configurations can be considered while setting up a Youpi environment: 

.. _standalone_installation:

- you can decide to perform a **standalone installation** in order to install everything, 
  i.e. Youpi and all its `dependencies`_, on the same Linux host. This way it is possible 
  to reduce data with tools installed locally (while accessing your images remotely, for 
  example over `NFS`_), which can be useful if you just want to give Youpi a try or if you 
  don't plan to setup a more complex installation involving several cluster nodes for 
  processing your data.

  .. note:: We provide a *standalone installation* on a `Live DVD`_ , available from 
            `Youpi's website`_. This is the quickest and easiest way to give Youpi a try. All 
            software packages are installed and are already configured for immediate use. 
            Everything is loaded at runtime into your computer's memory, so be sure to have 
            a rather powerful machine (with tons of memory!).

- Most often, you will want to perform a **network or cluster installation** if you want to 
  be able to process your images on a computer cluster. The *cluster installation* steps are 
  lighter than those required for a fully operational *standalone installation* because there 
  are much less software requirements. Most of the packages have only to be installated on the 
  cluster nodes, while the computer running Youpi only needs *Condor* and some Python software 
  packages.

  .. note:: In both cases, you always need to have a running Condor installation on the host 
            running Youpi. Indeed, Youpi needs to be able to submit jobs on the cluster (the 
            ``condor_submit`` command is used internally to submit jobs).

Getting Youpi
=============

The latest version of Youpi is available in the `download section`_ of Youpi's website.

Software Dependencies
=====================

As of today, running Youpi involves installing many software packages. Optional packages 
will enhance Youpi's functionalities and will improve the final user experience. As 
explained at the beginning of this chapter, the list of packages you need to install 
depends on the type of installation - *standalone* or *cluster* - you want to perform.

Dependencies Tree

Here is a partial dependency tree to better visualize Youpi's packages dependencies:
