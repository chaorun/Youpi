Installing Youpi
****************

This chapter is about installing Youpi in a *GNU/Linux* environment. Actually, it should 
work on most UNIX-like systems that support |python|_ (quite a lot). For example, Youpi 
is currently hosted on a `FreeBSD`_ server at |terapix|_. 

For the moment, two configurations can be considered while setting up a Youpi environment: 

.. _standalone_installation:

- you can decide to perform a **standalone installation** in order to install everything, 
  i.e. Youpi and all its `dependencies`_, on the same Linux host. This way it is possible 
  to reduce data with tools installed locally (while accessing your images remotely, for 
  example over `NFS`_), which can be useful if you just want to give Youpi a try or if you 
  don't plan to setup a more complex installation involving several cluster nodes for 
  processing your data.

  .. note:: We provide a *standalone installation* on a `Live DVD`_ , available from `Youpi's 
            website`_. This is the quickest and easiest way to give Youpi a try. All software 
            packages are installed and are already configured for immediate use. Everything is 
            loaded at runtime into your computer's memory, so be sure to have a rather powerful
            machine (with tons of memory!).
