Version 0.7
-----------

**Release Date**: *To Be Released*

**Improvements**:

- New CLI ``script/processing.py`` for batch deletion of DB processing. `Bug #222`_
- New Job History page on the results page which provide a list of all completed jobs. 
  `Bug #208`_
- Removed ``django-compress`` app from Youpi and use of standalone version. `Bug #218`_
- `Swarp`: successful processings are not reprocessed anymore, unless forced in the runtime options
- Added support for multiple output directories (all plugins). `Bug #217`_
- `Swarp`: added support for automatic compression algorithm detection for weight maps. `Bug #215`_
- New manual/automatic cart mode for Swarp: selections of images can be submitted automatically to 
  the processing cart. `Bug #210`_
- Added global runtime options panel in the processing cart. They now apply to the current 
  selection of items.
- Major processing cart redesign, which is faster and comes with 
  :ref:`more functionalities <the_processing_cart>`. `Bug #212`_
- Prevents processing cart items to be added twice. `Bug #211`_
- Enhanced image information page with more information and a full processing history list of jobs 
  related to that image. `Bug #206`_
- CLI Grading script ``script/grading.py`` has a new ``-k`` option to list available grades in the 
  database according to tag names.
- `Swarp` plugin: added support for custom external ``.head`` file input from `Scamp`.
- Reporting: added support for pagination for big tables.
- `QualityFITS`'s report "*List of all images with a selected grade*" can display the QFits result 
  page by clicking on the grade next no the image name. This report also comes with a pagination 
  system to speed up SQL queries by returning smaller result sets (using AJAX). 
- Redesigned the `ingestion history` panel; ingestions can be renamed and deleted, access rights to 
  ingestions can be changed using the permissions system.
- `QualityFITS` grading page: added available user comments; redesigned the grading interface.
- New `STIFF` plugin: `STIFF`_ is a program that converts scientific `FITS`  images to the more 
  popular `TIFF` format for illustration purposes. It is already used by the `Swarp` and `Sextractor` 
  plugins but was not available as an independant plugin. The `STIFF` plugin allows to generate 
  `TIFF` images of single images or stacks of images ingested with Youpi. Moreover, the final image 
  is viewable directly in the browser using the `IIPImage`_ open source streaming client-server system 
  which enables web-based viewing and zooming of ultra high-resolution images.
- `QualityFITS` plugin: added an option to force exiting immediately if the mask image is missing 
- `QualityFITS` plugin: checks for missing flat, mask or reg files are more efficient and are made at 
  the wrapper processing script level. If a `QualityFITS` job is configured to halt on missing file, it 
  will halt at the very beginning, without actually running the `QualityFITS` command itself. The job 
  will fail immediately.

  of nodes.

.. _Bug #223: https://youpi.terapix.fr/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=223

**Release Notes**:

In order to upgrade from 0.6.1, please do the following:

1. This version *no more includes* the code of the ``django-evolution`` application. At the time of this 
   writing, the ``django-evolution`` project distributes `official releases`_, so there is no need to include 
   it into Youpi's source tree anymore. Please install the official ``django-evolution`` release on 
   your server::

	$ sudo easy_install -U django_evolution

   Before restarting (or reloading) your webserver, please check that you don't have any ``django_evolution`` 
   directory in your ``$YOUPI_INSTALL_DIR/terapix`` installation directory. If it's there, just delete it since 
   it will prevent Django from importing the external, site-wide installation of the ``django_evolution`` 
   application correctly.

2. Make a **backup of your database**.

3. The database structure has changed. Just tell Youpi to inspect your installation and upgrade the database::

	$ python manage.py checksetup

Everytime the database structure has to be updated, you will be prompted for confirmation::

	Are you sure you want to execute the evolutions?
	Type 'yes' to continue, or 'no' to cancel:

If you have made a database backup, you can safely answer: ``yes``.

Version 0.6.1
-------------

**Release Date**: May 12, 2010

**Improvements**:

- `QualityFITS plugin`: added support for "single chip flat normalization", which allows to compute a new 
  normalisation based on independant chips. This is required to select the bad pixels from each chip in 
  a consistant way. **Important**: please note that this feature requires to use `QualityFITS 1.13.12` or 
  higher.
- `QualityFITS` results: displays grade's comment next to grade letter
- Added support for FITS keyword copying (+KEYWORD) in :ref:`ingestion translation tables (ITTs) <ingestion_section>`
- Added support for :ref:`automatic .head file generation <automatic_head_section>` to allow 
  FITS image header keywords overriding
- Added a ``can_change_custom_condor_req`` :ref:`global permission <global_permissions>` 
  to prevent users modifying their custom Condor requirement string
- New report "List of all QualityFITS grades, with comments (HTML)"
- New report "Advanced image report"
- Added report description and thumbnail preview to reporting module
- New ``MAINTENANCE`` mode for maintenance operations
- Various :ref:`performance improvements in production environment <improve_performance>` (by 
  combining static Javascript and CSS files into single files and `minifying`_ their content)
- New command line tool ``script/changeseeing.py`` to compute and store images pixel scale and 
  reprocess all `QualityFITS` XML output results. Please see the :ref:`Release Notes <script_changeseeing>` 
  for more information
- Clicking on your username (top-left corner) will popup information related to your active 
  permission attributes
- Data output directory: plugins append a random 8-chars string at the end of the data path to 
  prevent results to be overridden by mistake
- Post-processing: remote files not needed anymore at the end of processings are deleted

.. _minifying: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minify

**Bug fixes**:

- Processings will not fail anymore when working with re-ingested images
- Ingestion: fixed bug during target hostname resolution
- Image selector: stops loading and displays a user-friendly message when no images available 
  (no ingestions at all)
- `QualityFITS` results: hide "Image tags" block when image has no tags
- `QualityFITS` results: fixed permission issue. Non-authorized users cannot access restricted 
  results anymore
- `QualityFITS` results: fixed counter value for already graded images
- `QualityFITS`: fixed "list of all non graded images" report
- `QualityFITS`: fixed broken "reprocess" button on the results page
- `QualityFITS`: fixed psfex's XML output parsing
- Grading script: fixed custom comment issue
- Processing history results: fixed a ``Server Error`` issue when resetting the search form
- Path selector widget: fixed automatic path selection
- Minor fixes

.. warning:: Please note that `QualityFITS 1.13.12` or higher is required for this release to 
            work properly.

**Release Notes**:

In order to **upgrade from 0.6**, please do the following:

0. Make a **backup of your database**.

1. A third file ``private_conf.py`` is now taken into account for Youpi's configuration. Most of 
   the content of the ``settings.py-dist`` that comes with the distribution has been moved to the new 
   configuration file. The best (not the fastest) way to upgrade your ``settings.py`` file for this new 
   release is to make a backup of it and copy the content of the latest ``settings.py-dist``::

	$ cp settings.py settings.py.orig
	$ cp settings.py-dist settings.py

   Now, just replace the ``FIXME`` directives in your newly created ``settings.py`` with the working values 
   available in your ``settings.py.orig``.

   .. note:: Although this can be a tedious task, it is the more secure way to ensure your ``settings.py`` 
             file is up-to-date with the latest ``settings.py-dist`` file provided in the source distribution.
             Future upgrades will be easier since all core parts of the configuration have moved to the 
             ``private_conf.py`` file. Any new change will be directly committed to the file without 
             requiring anymore admin action on application upgrade.

.. _relnotes_yui:

2. The database structure has changed. Just tell Youpi to inspect your installation and upgrade 
   the database if needed::

	$ python manage.py checksetup

   Everytime the database structure has to be updated, you will be prompted for confirmation::

		Are you sure you want to execute the evolutions?
		Type 'yes' to continue, or 'no' to cancel:

   If you have made a database backup, you can safely answer: ``yes``.


3. CSS and Javascript file minification is accomplished  using Yahoo's `YUI Java compressor`_. In order 
   to use it with Youpi, make sure that Java is installed on your system and download the YUI compressor tool. 
   Then, add the following line to your ``settings.py`` file or (preferred) ``local_conf.py``, replacing the 
   absolute path to the JAR archive accordingly::

	COMPRESS_YUI_BINARY = "java -jar /path/to/yuicompressor-2.x.x.jar"

   .. note:: If, for any reason, you don't want to use the YUI compressor or Java at all, you can safely 
             disable the ``terapix.compress`` application by adding a ``COMPRESS = False`` line in your 
             settings file. This setting will disable minification.

   .. note:: We recommand using minification techniques when :ref:`deploying the application in a production environment <improve_performance>`.
             Although the included `django-compress`_ module works without using the YUI compressor (using its own 
             internal tools), the YUI compressor will generally give better results.

   .. _YUI Java compressor: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/
   .. _django-compress: http://code.google.com/p/django-compress/

4. *(This step is optional)* Now that everything is set up, you can generate the minified static 
   files from the command line (otherwise they get generated automatically on-the-fly)::

	$ python manage.py synccompress

.. _script_changeseeing:

5. *(This step is optional)* The database structure has been altered for this release. You may want to 
   compute images pixel scale values or reprocess all QualityFITS XML results using the 
   ``script/changeseeing.py`` script. Try a::

	$ python script/changeseeing.py -p -v

   to compute all images pixel scale, then:: 

	$ python script/changeseeing.py -q -v

   to reingest all successful QualityFITS XML results. Other options are available through 
   the ``changeseeing.py -h`` command.

   .. note:: Those two commands may take a long time to complete depending on the amount of 
             information stored in your database.

Version 0.6
-----------

**Release Date**: January 28, 2010

**Improvements**:

- Added support for :ref:`Generic FITS image ingestion <ingestion_section>` using translation tables (ITTs)
- Added several :ref:`global permissions <global_permissions>` in order to be able to define more restrictive user accounts 
- `QualityFITS` plugin: added an option to force exiting a QFits job immediately if the flat image 
  is missing 
- Current user permissions are available on the "Preferences" page 
- Results page: added more search criteria; processing results can be searched by *tags*
- Added new self-designed icon set (GUI)
- Added a keyboard shortcut (Alt+Shift+g) for accessing the image grading page from the results page
- New path tool script useful to display/alter important data paths  stored in the database

**Bug fixes**:

- Results page: fixed the "already graded images" counter's value 
- Minor fixes

.. _Many more...: https://youpi.terapix.fr/mercurial/youpi/trunk/shortlog

**Release Notes**:

In order to upgrade from 0.5.2, please do the following:

0. Make a **backup of your database**.

1. The database structure has changed. Just tell Youpi to inspect your installation and upgrade the database::

	$ python manage.py checksetup

Everytime the database structure has to be updated, you will be prompted for confirmation::

	Are you sure you want to execute the evolutions?
	Type 'yes' to continue, or 'no' to cancel:

If you have made a database backup, you can safely answer: ``yes``.

Version 0.5.2
-------------

**Release Date**: November 28, 2009

**Improvements**:

- Check setup script: handles database schema updates automatically; now handles default condor setup parameters 
- Core API related to Condor cluster management greatly improved 
- Monitoring Condor jobs from the "Active Monitoring" page is much faster 
- Plugin manager OOP design improved
- Removed all parts related to preingestion step (no more needed) 

**Bug fixes**:

- Fixed processing cart issues (session related)
- Fixed the "Software version check" feature
- `Swarp` plugin: fixed final stack ingestion issues; fixed bug preventing swarp item cluster submission
- `Sextractor` plugin: fixed bad weight image name in dual image mode; fixed a data path issue
- All plugins: fixed bad XSL stylesheet URI handling

**Release Notes**:

In order to upgrade from 0.5.1, please do the following:

.. warning:: Following these steps in order is important. Please do not issue a ``checksetup`` 
             command before step 4. The database structure has to be manually altered first (step 1).

0. Make a **backup of your database**.

1. Connect to your MySQL databsase and issue the following statements::

	$ python manage.py dbshell
	mysql> alter table youpi_image drop `QSOstatus`;
	mysql> alter table youpi_image add `is_validated` bool;
	mysql> update youpi_image set is_validated=1;
	mysql> alter table youpi_ingestion drop `check_QSO_status`;
	mysql> alter table youpi_ingestion add `is_validated` bool;
	mysql> update youpi_ingestion set is_validated=1;

   .. note:: you have to do this upgrade manually when updating from version 0.5.1 to 0.5.2. Future
             database upgrades will be performed automatically using the "Django evolution" 
             application activated at step 3.

2. From the ``settings.py-dist`` file, copy the ``YOUPI_ACTIVE_PLUGINS`` variable 
   into your ``settings.py`` or ``local_conf.py`` file::

	YOUPI_ACTIVE_PLUGINS = ('qualityfitsin', 'scamp', 'swarp', 'sextractor')

3. Edit your ``settings.py`` file and add the line ``terapix.django_evolution`` to your 
   ``INSTALLED_APPS`` variable so it looks like the following::

	INSTALLED_APPS = (
	...
	'terapix.django_evolution',
	'terapix.youpi',
	)


4. Finally, let Youpi inspect your installation setup and tell the ``django-evolution`` application to 
   make an initial snapshot of the database structure::

	$ python manage.py checksetup

Version 0.5.1

            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
            of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this 
License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or 
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
